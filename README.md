# Python Boilerplate

This repo reatures
* `pdm` for package management
* `mypy` for type checking
* `flake8` for linting
* `black` for formatting
* `bandit` for security audits
* `pytest` for testing framework
* `notebook` pre-installed

## TODO
* merge `.flake8` into `pyproject.toml` once package supports it
* delete `PYTHONPATH` from `.env` when vscode gets PEP-582 support
